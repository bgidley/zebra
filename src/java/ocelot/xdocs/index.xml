		<section name="What is this?">
			<p>This is the maven site for the ocelot component of Zebra and 
				Antelope</p>
			<p>Ocelot is a a tomcat filter to prevent users having more than 
				one http request at at time. This behaviour is ONLY suitable 
				for some applications and in a general website would be a very 
				bad idea</p>
			<p>This is designed to handle the situation in apps where a user 
				clicks a button multiple times and we only want the action to 
				perform once.</p>

			<p>See #set ($url = $escape.getText($project.issueTrackingUrl)) <a 
				href="$url">$url</a> for known issues with meercat</p>

		<section name="Future Plans">
			<p>This may be extended to support multiple browser windows using 
				some kind of window session using URL rewriting</p>
