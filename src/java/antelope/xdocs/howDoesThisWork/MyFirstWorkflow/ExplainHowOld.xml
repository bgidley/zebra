        <section name="HowOldAreYou">
            <p>On the "How old are you" page the user's name is confirmed and the age of the user is
                requested. As information is to be displayed on this page, the information must be
                provided by the screen class. the relevant part of HowOldAreYou.java is shown here.</p>
            <source><![CDATA[
public class HowOldAreYou extends BaseWorkflowScreen {

	public static final String	AGE	= "age";

	/**
	 * Prepare Data if needed
	 */
	protected void doBuildTemplate(RunData runData, Context context,
			AntelopeTaskInstance taskInstance, FormTool tool) throws Exception {

		//need to display name on page so it is placed into the context to be displayed as text,
		//NOT as a field. the name is taken from the process instance's property set 
		context.put(Hello.NAME,
			((AntelopePropertySetEntry) ((AntelopeProcessInstance) taskInstance
					.getProcessInstance()).getPropertySet().get(
				"name")).getValue());

	}
}
                ]]></source>
            <p>This code gets the string value out of the AntelopePropertySetEntry using the
                .getValue() method and puts it into the context where it will be cleared once the
                page is displayed. As can be seen below in the vm file the template is much the same
                as Hello except it has the line which displays the user's name from the context</p>
            <source><![CDATA[
<form name="hello" method="post" action="$link.setAction("myFirstWorkflow.HowOldAreYouAction")">

## get age field from form tool
#set ($age = $form.Fields.get("age"))

## show error if incorrect
#showFieldError($age)

## $name is taken straight from the string placed into the context in the screen class
## $age is a field which is then filled in
<p>Hello $name</p>
<p>How old are you? <input type="text" name="age" value="$age.value" size="$age.size" maxlength="$age.maxLength"/></p>


<p><input type="submit" name="cancel" value="Cancel"/>
<input type="submit" name="pause" value="Pause" />
<input type="submit" name="done" value="Done" /></p>
</form>
                ]]></source>
            <p>The action class for HowOldAreYou is similar to Hello's and so there's no need to go
                into any more detail here.</p>
