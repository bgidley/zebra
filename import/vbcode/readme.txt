There are several commercial licensed (sorry!) components you'll need in order to compile the Visual Basic code. Most have freely downloadable trial versions though that will enable you to run and debug the code in the Visual Basic IDE (with the odd nag / popup).

1. Visual Basic 6.0 - valid licensed copy required!

2. Microsoft XML4 libraries (available as free download from Microsoft)

3. Innovasys Dockstudio XP v1 (not tested against v2) - trial available from http://www.innovasys.co.uk

4. Lassalle Technologies AddFlow4 - trial available from http://www.lassalle.com

5. VideoSoft VSFlexGrid Pro v7.0 (not tested against v8) - trial available from http://www.videosoft.com (company now known as ComponentOne)

All compiled OCX's and DLL's that make up the designer will also obviously need to be registered using regsvr.exe in order to load up the main designer project...
